# Responsive-Portfolio

Used bootstrap to create and style three webpages: index.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html.    
   
index.html:   
Made an "About Me" page with a placeholder for an image of myself and placeholder Lorem for a bio. Also included two butons for links to my social media.     
    
contact.html:   
Made a "Contact" page where users can input their Name, Email, and a Message and submit it to me.   
   
portfolio.html:   
Made a "Portfolio" page with placeholder images for my personal projects.   
   
All pages used semantic html and bootstrap classes such as containers, rows, and columns so that they are responsive on 'xs' and 's' screens.
